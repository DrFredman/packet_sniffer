# packet_sniffer

This tool is to be used together with the arp_spoof.py script. Firstly, run the arp_spoof.py script, then run this script. 
Also, this tool can only read http traffic and not https traffic, which most websites use nowadays. You can still use this tool to sniff incoming credentials on sites like http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php however I don't plan on publishing an HTTPS version. 
IMPORTANT! This tool is only for educational purposes only and is to be used with consent. Misuse of this tool can get you into serious trouble and I do not encourage illegal shenanigans. Thank you.
